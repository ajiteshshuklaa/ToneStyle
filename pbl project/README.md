\# TONE STYLE – Skin Tone Detection Project



\## 📌 Project Overview

TONE STYLE is a machine learning–based project that detects human skin tone using image processing techniques. The system analyzes facial images captured via webcam or input images and predicts the skin tone category using a trained deep learning model.



This project demonstrates the practical application of Python, OpenCV, and deep learning in real-world computer vision tasks.
